Do you want me or do you not
I heard one thing now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot it's 2 am it feels like summer
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
I hum it on the phone like every night
And sing it for my babies on the tour life
If he's a serial killer then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl who's already hurt
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
